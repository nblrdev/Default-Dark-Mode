# Expanded Storage source code repository
There's going to be some changes over the next 2 weeks however here's the gist of it.
1. The master branch will always be All Rights Reserved, it's for assets and ideas.
2. The mod source code will be published under something more permissive, most likely apache license v2.
3. The mod assets will remain All Rights Reserved with few exceptions which include:
   1. The textures made by Yoghurt4C are public domain, use them how you like, this is limited to the pumpkin chest and christmas chest textures.
   2. The localization from the issue tracker repo is 0BSD, use them how you like.

If your mod integrates with expanded storage in any way please get in touch, so I can provide a non-breaking way to access the mod.

That's all ðŸ˜„
