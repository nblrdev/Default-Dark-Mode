# NinjaPhenix's Container Library
## Synopsis
In short this contains all the code from Expanded Storage used to open inventories including the different screen options.

## Consuming the library
If you are to consume this library please jar in jar it or have users download it from Curseforge or Modrinth:
- Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ninjaphenixs-container-library
- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/ninjaphenix-container-library

Whilst you may fork and shade this project and add your own features I would prefer to avoid multiple versions of the library as it would worsen the user experience.

Therefore, if anything can be added to help please let me know or feel free to open a PR.

## Planned features
- Texture generation before screens are opened.
- User configurable screen sizes including empty slots, will likely generate separate textures for blanked slots rather than in game rendering approach used now.
- Allow changing screen type depending on size of inventory. e.g. page screen for 135 slots, single for 108 slots
